# Password Manager

## Description

According to DigitalInformationWorld about 73% of people reset their passwords. Unfortunately I fall into this statistic
During Summer 2022 I decided to create a password manager using the naive method (that is , storing all passswords without encryption)
to keep all my passwords to access any time. 

In this project, I used PostgreSQL as the relational database to manage the passwords and Java to to create the backend and 
Java Swing for the front end. 

## Lessons
- In this project I learned some postgreSQL commands and how to use a database
- I learned the importance of reading documentation. I struggled with understanding how Java database connectivity (JDBC) works, and tried to use youtube
videos. But once I decided to read documentation it became easy
- I learned the importance of modularity. On previous projects, I did not apply this principle of object-oriented programming and run into many difficulties.
